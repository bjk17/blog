And when your project revolves around servers, networking and self-hosting services you may as well set up your own blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so I did just that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Picking a framework&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could easily have chosen a blogging platform such as &lt;a href="https://www.blogger.com/"&gt;Blogger&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://ghost.org/"&gt;Ghost&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://medium.com/"&gt;Medium&lt;/a&gt; to save me all the hazzle. However, I'm curious about servers, networks and infrastructure so I took this chance to set up and host my own blog. It's a healthy experience for every Software Developer to do Operations from time to time. Eventually, if I get fed up on managing my own server I'll move the blog to some hosted platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started looking around to see what other people did for their blog. At first I though about installing a fully blown CMS system on my server (inside a container or virtual machine) such as &lt;a href="https://wordpress.org/"&gt;WordPress&lt;/a&gt;. I was very close to &lt;a href="http://support.ghost.org/developers/"&gt;self-hosting Ghost&lt;/a&gt; after reading &lt;a href="https://blog.anmoljagetia.me/why-ghost/"&gt;Anmol Jagetia's Blog&lt;/a&gt;. The biggest pro's of a CMS system is the ability to write your blog in a simple WYSIWYG fashion from whatever computer you're using. But in the end I decided to go for a static blog site generator framwork without any server-side logic. Comments would be handled by &lt;a href="https://disqus.com/"&gt;Disqus&lt;/a&gt; plugin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I searched for and stumbled upon three strong candidates: &lt;a href="https://jekyllrb.com/"&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://blog.getpelican.com/"&gt;Pelican&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://github.com/stef/utterson"&gt;Utterson&lt;/a&gt;. Jekyll seems to be the most active project and is amongst other things &lt;a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/github-pages/"&gt;powering GitHub Pages&lt;/a&gt; behind the scenes. Utterson is very simple and elegant and uses Unix shell scripting instead of high-level programming languages. I tried all three and ended on choosing Pelican mainly because I found &lt;a href="https://blog.alexandrevicenzi.com/flex-pelican-theme.html"&gt;a beautiful theme&lt;/a&gt; and it was the easiest to configure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Hosting the blog&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So now the process is this: I write my blogposts in Markdown on my laptop, then I render them to HTML with Pelican, commit and push them to my &lt;a href="https://github.com/bjk17/blog"&gt;GitHub repository&lt;/a&gt; and then finally &lt;code&gt;git pull&lt;/code&gt; them on my server. The process is a bit more manual then I'd prefer as I don't have direct SSH access to where I host my blog site. (I serve it from an LXC/LXD container behind an Apache proxy, but more on that later.) Pelican has built-in deployment tools that can render and deploy directly to your server over SSH. I would need to change my server infrastructure to be able to deploy in this way. This is something I will think about. It's ugly and &lt;em&gt;semantically incorrect&lt;/em&gt; (I'll be using this phrase a lot) to keep both the markdown files and the rendered HTML in source control. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the next few blog posts I want to write about my current server architecture/infrastructure hobby project and all the technical tidbits related to that. After all, that's why I started this blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I appreciate all kinds of feedback so please drop a comment or send me an email if you like what I'm dealing with or have something to say.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="DevOps"></category><category term="Pelican"></category></entry></feed>
